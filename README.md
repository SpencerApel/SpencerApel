### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [sxvv](https://github.com/SpencerApel/sxvv)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about plants, engines, C programming
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any of my repos
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with [sxvv](https://github.com/SpencerApel/sxvv)

#### Check out my Arch Linux [dotfiles](https://github.com/SpencerApel/dotfiles)/configuration files
#### Check out [sxvv](https://github.com/SpencerApel/sxvv)
- Simple X Video Viewer
- Linux program to view your video files in thumbnail mode, then open in video viewer

#### Check out my [scripts](https://github.com/SpencerApel/dotfiles/tree/master/.local/bin)
- Currently located in dotfiles repo, will be migrated into scripts repo with submodule in dotfiles

**SpencerApel/SpencerApel** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
